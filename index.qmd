- Uses **star schema**.
- Retains **summarized data**, short-term.
- Easier to manage (< 100GB).
- Can be dependent, independent, or hybrid.

### 🔹 Data Warehouse
- Central data repository for entire org.
- Integrates multiple subject areas.
- Large-scale, long-term historical storage.
- Uses complex schemas (star, snowflake, etc).
- Supports deep analytics and BI.
- Stores detailed **normalized/denormalized** data.
- Subject-oriented and time-variant.

### 🔹 Reliability
- System works correctly even if parts fail.
- Needs testing, error recovery, monitoring.

### 🔹 Scalability
- Handles growth in data/users/load.
- Measured using response time, load metrics.

### 🔹 Maintainability
- Easy to fix, extend, and operate.
- Key principles: **operability**, **simplicity**, **evolvability**.
