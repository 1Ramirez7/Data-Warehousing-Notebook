If you follow the steps below on adding new files and editing the _quarto.yml your site should always render. I do not focus to much on the QMD details as that is one of the main concepts we have been working on in class. So you can edit the QMD files as you see fit, and as long as they render locally, they will be published to the site.\n\nGo to Potential Errors and Bugs\nThe following are instructions to edit this portfolio separated into sections. Each section is intended to show how to add and or edit different parts of the portfolio."
